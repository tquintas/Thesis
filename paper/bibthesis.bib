In order to validate this model, the attenuation was measured using a pulse technique with four transducer pairs, each with a different resonant frequency. The attenuation calculated using the model was compared to the measured values for a variety of gases including: air, oxygen, methane, hydrogen, and mixtures of oxygen/nitrogen, methane/nitrogen, carbon dioxide/nitrogen, and hydrogen/nitrogen. After the measured data is corrected for diffraction, the model matches the trends in the measured attenuation spectrum for this extensive set of gas mixtures.}",

The calculated curves based upon 24 energy transfer mechanisms are compared with experimental data over the humidity range of 0–100\\% relative humidity. Agreement between theory and experiment is very good. By including classical absorption and rotational relaxation effects, the total atmospheric absorption is also predicted at 20°C. Calculations made for various concentrations of CO2 indicate that low CO2 levels (less than 0.1\\%) do not significantly affect absorption of audible sound at high humidities. At very low humidities, however, CO2 is an important factor.}",
